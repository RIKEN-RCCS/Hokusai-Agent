"""MCP server for searching the HOKUSAI BigWaterfall2 (HBW2) guide.

Read-only and needs no SSH access. Uses the pre-built packaged index in
hokusai_mcp/data/docs_index (built from hokusai_mcp/data/hokusai_guide.md, an
original orientation guide). Search is BM25
keyword matching by default; if an embedding endpoint is configured and the index
has vectors, semantic search is used instead, with fallback to keyword search.
